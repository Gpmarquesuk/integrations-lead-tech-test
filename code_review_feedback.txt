Hi Lottie,

I've had a chance to review the code in WindowsAPIProject.cpp, and overall, it looks well-structured and follows best practices. Here are a few points for consideration:

1. **Consistency in Naming:**
	Ensure that variable and function names follow a consistent naming convention. In C++, it's common to use CamelCase for function names and camelCase for variable names.
	Verify that naming accurately reflects the purpose or content of the variable or function.
   - I noticed that the variable naming is generally consistent, but there are a few places where it deviates slightly. For instance, in `InitInstance`, the window handle is named `hWnd`, while in `WndProc`, it's named `hWnd` as well. It might be helpful to maintain consistent naming across functions.
	Example:
	// Inconsistent naming in InitInstance function
	HWND hWnd = CreateWindowW(szWindowClass, szTitle, WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW, CW_USEDEFAULT, 0, CW_USEDEFAULT, 0, nullptr, nullptr, hInstance, nullptr);

	// Suggested improvement
	HWND mainWindowHandle = CreateWindowW(szWindowClass, szTitle, WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW, CW_USEDEFAULT, 0, CW_USEDEFAULT, 0, nullptr, nullptr, hInstance, nullptr);


2. **Error Handling:**
	Ensure that error handling is robust and provides useful information for debugging.
   - In `wWinMain`, there's a check for `InitInstance` failure, which is great. However, it might be beneficial to provide more detailed error information to aid debugging.
	Example:
    // Existing error handling
	if (!InitInstance(hInstance, nCmdShow)) {
    return FALSE;
	}
	// Suggested improvement
    if (!InitInstance(hInstance, nCmdShow)) {
        // Consider logging or showing an error message with more details about the failure.
        return GetLastError();
    }
    
3. **Comments:**
	Evaluate whether the code is self-explanatory. If certain parts are complex or might be unclear to someone else reading the code, I suggest adding comments to explain the logic or purpose.
	Comments should not state the obvious but rather provide insights into why something is done a certain way.
   - The code is generally self-explanatory, but consider adding a few comments where the logic might be non-trivial, especially in `WndProc`. This could help anyone maintaining the code in the future.
	Example:
	// Existing comment
	// TODO: Place code here.

	// Suggested improvement
	// TODO: If there are any specific initialization steps required at this point, add comments explaining them.

	
4. **Resource IDs:**
	Confirm that the code assumes correct definitions of resource IDs in associated resource files.
	I suggest adding a comment to clarify this assumption, ensuring that future maintainers are aware of it.
   - It's assumed that the resource IDs are correctly defined in associated resource files, as they are used throughout the code. A brief comment mentioning this assumption might be helpful.
   Example:
   // Existing usage of resource IDs
	LoadStringW(hInstance, IDS_APP_TITLE, szTitle, MAX_LOADSTRING);

	// Suggested improvement
	// Assuming that resource IDs like IDS_APP_TITLE are correctly defined in resource files.
	 LoadStringW(hInstance, IDS_APP_TITLE, szTitle, MAX_LOADSTRING);


5. **Extensibility:**
	Acknowledge the code's extensibility and suggest how additional features or improvements could be integrated seamlessly.
	Consider commenting on potential areas for future expansion.
   - The code structure allows for easy extensibility. If there are plans to expand the application, it might be worth commenting on how new features could be integrated seamlessly.



Thanks for the effort you've put into the code! Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything specific you'd like further feedback on.

Kind Regards,
Gustavo Marques
